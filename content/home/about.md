# Biography

I study soil ecology within my PhD at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Bangor University. I look at the impact of plant and microbial communities upon hydrological properties of the soil, specifically soil water repellency. I also try to understand how the diversity of the soil environment and plant diversity impact the diversity and composition of the soil microbial communities. Most of this work is using data from the field survey within Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme [GMEP](https://gmep.wales/) which surveyed sites across Wales for a wide variety of properties. I also look at the impact of simulated climate change on microbial communities in an [upland heathland site maintained by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/monitoring-site/experimental-sites-uplands-monitoring-and-soil-research).

The main reason for this website is to store copies of the tutorials I have written for the R club I run. They're currently stored under tutorials, and I hope someone finds them useful!
