<p>I recently finished a three-month placement at <a href="https://uk.ramboll.com/">Ramboll</a>, a civil engineering consultancy, in Southampton. I was given the opportunity to work with the Environment team there as part of an industry placement funded by the National Productivity Investment Fund (NPIF).</p>
<p>During my placement I helped out with many different projects and got a great overview of what Rambollâ€™s environmental consultancy does. Ramboll is involved in a wide variety of projects and I was able to learn more and help with things ranging across various environmental impact assessments, site visits to new and ongoing schemes, and creating promotional material for recent exciting projects. I also assisted the team by researching a wide variety of topics and providing summary information on topics ranging from the adapting built infrastructure to climate change to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.</p>
<p>One of the main outputs from my placement was taking the UK Climate Projections released in 2018 by the Met Office (<a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/ukcp">UKCP18</a>) and building an interactive app using R Shiny for users to easily get outputs that they could use in environmental impact assessments. This was a great opportunity for me to expand my skills while providing staff within the climate resilience network at Ramboll with a new tool. I was able to feedback information to Ramboll on the outputs from the climate projections, how to interpret their associated uncertainties, and how best to use them in their work.</p>
<p>Overall this placement was a great opportunity for me to get involved in a sector that I had no experience in and see how companies work outside of academia. Everyone at Ramboll was incredibly welcoming and friendly and I very much enjoyed the opportunity to contribute as part of the team. I am very grateful to STARS and the NPIF for giving me this opportunity which will greatly help me make the decisions and next steps post-PhD; and also allowed me to live and work in the New Forest so I could explore a beautiful area and gain invaluable experience in dealing with animals on the road!</p>
