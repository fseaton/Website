This is a collection of R tutorials I have written for the R club that I run at Bangor.  

# Useful resources

* For those who are new to R, or returning after a long absence, the [swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) R package is really useful as it teaches you R interactively from the console.

* [Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) hosted by RStudio offer a handy quick reference to various packages and techniques - really useful for when you can't quite remember the name of the function you used before. Cheatsheets on non-RStudio packages are at the bottom of the page.

* Tutorials from [Our Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/) cover a wide variety of topics and can be a great resource.


# Featured packages
I like to feature an R package in the R club emails that I've found to be useful or otherwise interesting. I'll list the ones mentioned so far here for reference, and update when I remember to:

* [**janitor**](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) offers some great functions for examining and cleaning dirty data
* [**colourpicker**](https://daattali.com/shiny/colourInput/) is an interactive colour picker that comes with a Plot Colour Helper tool as an RStudio Addin which allows you to interactively pick colours to use in your plots.
* [**styler**](http://styler.r-lib.org/) provides tools for formatting your code so it becomes easier to read (also with RStudio Addin)
* [**summarytools**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=summarytools) has some really useful functions for quickly and neatly summarising data - see my tutorials on the sidebar for examples
* [**roperators**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roperators) has some interesting functions to "make syntax a bit nicer" - worth a look at the introduction vignette as I can't summarise it all here!
* [**extrafont**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=extrafont) is the classic package for using more fonts in your plots. I feel like my life is so much more complete now I can title my plots using the Star Trek title font
* [**car**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=car) offers so many functions related to regression, see the tutorials in the sidebar for examples
* [**broom**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broom) takes the messy output of functions such as lm or t.test and turns them into tidy data frames
* [**viridis**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=viridis) offers a selection of colourblind friendly palettes
* [**paletteer**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=paletteer) offers every colour palette in any package in R (or at least tries to). There's an associated [github repo](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) with pictures of them all and useful colour-related information
