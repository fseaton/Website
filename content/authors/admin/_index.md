I work as a quantitative ecologist within the Land Use Group in the [UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk). I started my research associate position there in March 2020, which has so far involved doing data analysis on a variety of ecological field surveys.

My PhD was in soil ecology at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Bangor University. I looked at the relationships between soil structure, biodiversity and health - which is a fancy way of saying that I did a lot of disparate analyses! Most of this work was using data from the field survey within Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme [(GMEP)](https://gmep.wales/) which surveyed sites across Wales for a wide variety of properties. I also looked at the impact of simulated climate change on microbial communities in an [upland heathland site maintained by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/monitoring-site/experimental-sites-uplands-monitoring-and-soil-research).

The main reason for building this website originally was to store copies of the tutorials I wrote for the R club I ran in Bangor. They're currently stored under tutorials, and I hope someone finds them useful!
