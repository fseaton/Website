The Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme was a project funded by the Welsh Government in order to take stock of the Welsh countryside and examine how the Welsh agri-environment scheme was performing. There was a national-scale field survey that took place over the summers of 2013-16, along with various modelling efforts. A full description of the project, its findings and reports are on its [website](https://gmep.wales/).
